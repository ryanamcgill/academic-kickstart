Currently working for the defense contractor Dynetics Inc. to investigate ways of 
'hacking' an army provided phased array radar via hardware vulnerabilities. Current 
tasks include emulating the radar hardware environment and investigating pathways 
to attack the system, both from standoff distance and from an operational perspective.
