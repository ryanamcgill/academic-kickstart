For our senior design project, me and a friend proposed a project to upgrade our 
beautiful Smith chart that lies on the bottom floor of Broun Hall in Auburn. 

<b>The Problem:</b>

Renovations done to Broun Hall included a large Smith chart on the bottom floor 
of the building. Since it is printed on a marker friendly surface, it offers 
utility towards struggling emag students. However, no protractor exists that is 
easy to use and large enough to work with. Thus, the whiteboard lies dormant. 

<b>Our Proposal:</b>

A standard projector can be mounted on the same wall of the white board either 
an adjustable mount or a short-throw. A computer (such as a Raspberry Pi) will 
be attached to several sensors in order to create a functioning "smart board". 
This can be realized with IR sensors, Wii remotes, and XBOX Kinects. Each
option will be evaluated to determine the best route to take.

Above is a rough outline of what our testing apparatus will look like. Before
fully implementing our design we need to prove that the system will work, 
which is why a large, ground-dwelling mount will have to be used initially.
