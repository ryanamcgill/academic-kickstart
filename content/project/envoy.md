Can't say too much about this project! ENVOY is a system that will allow 
natural-language communication between ASL and non-ASL users. This is done by 
translating ASL to English, and then English back to ASL. Applications that 
are in development today try to focus on translating ASL to spoken or written 
English and stop there. This project is intended to 'complete the circuit' by 
translating the non-ASL user's response into ASL. We are proposingthis idea 
because ASL speakers prefer to communicate in, well, ASL!

This project is a part of the 'Intern Innovative Idea Challenge' (I3C) that is 
done during the summer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Currently the project has 
passed the first round (staff voting) and is participating in the 
second round (poster presentation).
