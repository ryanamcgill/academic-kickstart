<b>MIT Lincoln Laboratory Intern Innovative Idea Challenge - Final Round - First Place</b>

<b>MIT Lincoln Laboratory Intern Innovative Idea Challenge - Round Two - Best Poster Award</b>  

ENVOY is a system that will allow  natural-language communication between ASL 
and non-ASL users. This is done by translating ASL to English, and then English 
back to ASL. Applications that are in development today try to focus on 
translating ASL to spoken or written English and stop there. This project is 
intended to 'complete the circuit' by translating the non-ASL user's response 
into ASL. We are proposing this idea because ASL speakers prefer to communicate 
in, well, ASL! 

The two biggest challenges facing ASL translation are the lack of large datasets 
to train systems and unreliable language models. In this project, we propose two 
solutions that can help alleviate this problems and allow two-way communication 
for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals.

This project is a part of the 'Intern Innovative Idea Challenge' (I3C) that is 
done during the summer at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. Projects are proposed to 
laboratory staff to decide which get funded and added to development.

Thanks to everyones hard work, we were able to secure funding to continue 
creating this system for MIT Lincoln Laboratory!
