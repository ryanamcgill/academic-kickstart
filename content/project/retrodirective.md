This project's primary objective is to create an IC capable of retro-
directive beamforming in a phased antena array system. This allows the 
antenna to automatically point in the direction of the strongest signal
instead of spending time on beam steering techniques. Further, we can 
create interesting configurations of the array for different applications.

I am assisting a graduate student to test this design by measuring the 
timing charecteristics of the system. Currently the IC design is being 
optimized and fabricated with testing slated for Fall 2019. I have assisted 
in charecterizing capacitor crystals for the IC using a FieldFox Spectrum 
Analyze as well as designed a testing apparatus for the transmitter / 
receiver. I was also able to begin soldering some of the components down 
for one of the testing boards.
