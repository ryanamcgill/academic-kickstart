As a project from the Air Force University Nano-satellite Program, QUEST aims
to prove that secure communication can be realized via quantum key 
distribution from a ground station to a satellite. 

I am contributing to the payload section of the satellite. In order to achieve 
quantum key distribution, the satellite's downlink beam must be aligned with the
ground station. Currently I am designing an embedded controller to take in 
camera data from the uplink and downlink beams and drive a fast steering mirror
to achieve alignment.
