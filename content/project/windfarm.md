Can't say too much about this project! Each year countries put up more and
more wind turbines that are only growing in size. 

Legacy radars are being impacted as wind turbine blades happen to have 
similar radar cross sections as target aircraft. The spinning of these blades 
gives a doppler return at the radar site. Further, wind farms generally 
contain turbines that are spaced close together. All of these factors contribute
to pockets of low probability of detection and tracking which translates to 
potential 'holes' in air surveillance.
