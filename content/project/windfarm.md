Interference from wind turbines can degrade the performance of radar by providing 
a large cross section and Doppler signal.  Further, wind farms generally contain 
turbines that are spaced close together. All of these factors contribute to 
pockets of poor radar performance near wind farms and is a concern for flight 
safety.  As the investment in wind energy increases it is important to understand 
the potential impact of these farms on legacy radar.
